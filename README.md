This project was created to try out Gradle and provide an example additions to the Java Stack currently
used for a project at work.

This stack is as follows:

* Spring Framework
* Apache CXF, currently used to expose JAX-WS SOAP services
* Hibernate
* Dozer
* JUnit

The additions illustrated in this project are:

* Gradle build tool
* Apache CXF, JAX-RS Restful services
* JPA
* Integration Testing completely separated from unit tests

I plan to add some additional examples these are:

* Using YAML for fixtures rather than Java classes with static data.
* JaspCrypt password and data encryption.
* SPOCK tests using groovy

TODO:

* Need to bind the DAO to the webservice tier.
